Make sure CPU 1 is full dynticks (it must be in the "nohz_full=" boot parameter
cpu mask).

To run:
	$ make
	# ./run

Look at the resulting trace in trace.1
hrtimer events should report you the tick events (unless you haven't
CONFIG_HRTIMER=y) and tick_stop events tell you what's going on with full dynticks
behaviour.

trace.1.example shows an example of a successful full dynticks behaviour. The
tick got mostly stopped during the execution of the user loop.
